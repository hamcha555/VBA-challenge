RESUBMISSION on November 1, 2021

First, sorry about the missing screenshots. I added missing screenshots to resubmit this homework in this gitHub repo.

Second, I am confused by grader comment about 'run time error'. I re-ran VBA module "v3 StockSummary_BONUS 10272021" and did not get errors on October 27 or after reviewing assignment comments on November 1. I have made no changes to the VBA file "v3 StockSummary_BONUS 10272021" in this gitHub repo.

Please advise and reply with any questions. Thank you.

ORIGINAL SUBMISSION  October 27, 2021

Following instructions I built script in parts

1. v1 | built script to function in one sheet
1. v2 | built script to function in across all sheets in workbook
1. v3 | built script to function in across all sheets in workbook and include bonus

For completed assignment, please us [v3 StockSummary_BONUS 10272021.vb]
