RESUBMISSION on November 1, 2021

I am confused.  Grader commented that there was a runtime error when they ran the bile.  I re-ran VBA module "v3 StockSummary_BONUS 10272021" I do not get any run time errors before or after original submission.  I have made no changes to the VBA file "v3 StockSummary_BONUS 10272021".

I also added missing screenshot to resubmit this homework.
Please advise and reply with any questions.

ORIGINAL SUBMISSION  October 27, 2021
